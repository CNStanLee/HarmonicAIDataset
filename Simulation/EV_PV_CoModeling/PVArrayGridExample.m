%% Description
%  
% A 100-kW PV array is connected to a 25-kV grid via a DC-DC boost converter and a three-phase three-level Voltage Source Converter (VSC).
% Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is implemented in the boost converter by means of a Simulink(R) model using the
% 'Incremental Conductance + Integral Regulator' technique.
% 
% Another example (see PVArrayGridAverageModel model) uses average models for the DC_DC and VSC converters.
% In this average model the MPPT controller is based on the 'Perturb and Observe' technique.
%
% The detailed model contains the following components: 
%
% *  *PV array* delivering a maximum of 100 kW at 1000 W/m^2 sun irradiance.
% *  *5-kHz DC-DC boost converter* increasing voltage from PV natural voltage (273 V DC at maximum power) to 500 V DC.
% Switching duty cycle is optimized by a MPPT controller that uses the 'Incremental Conductance + Integral Regulator' technique. 
% This MPPT system automatically varies the duty cycle in order to generate the required voltage to extract maximum power.
% *  *1980-Hz 3-level 3-phase VSC*. The VSC converts the 500 V DC link voltage to 260 V AC and keeps unity power factor.
% The VSC control system uses two control loops: an external control loop which regulates DC link voltage to +/- 250 V and 
% an internal control loop which regulates Id and Iq grid currents (active and reactive current components).
% Id current reference is the output of the DC voltage external controller. 
% Iq current reference is set to zero in order to maintain unity power factor. Vd and Vq voltage outputs of the current controller
% are converted to three modulating signals Uabc_ref used by the PWM Generator.
% The control system uses a sample time of 100 microseconds for voltage and current controllers as well as for the PLL synchronization unit.
% Pulse generators of Boost and VSC converters use a fast sample time of 1 microsecond in order 
% to get an appropriate resolution of PWM waveforms.
% *  *10-kvar capacitor bank* filtering harmonics produced by VSC. 
% *  *100-kVA 260V/25kV three-phase coupling transformer*.
% *  *Utility grid* (25-kV distribution feeder + 120 kV equivalent
% transmission system).
%
% The 100-kW PV array uses 330 SunPower modules (SPR-305E-WHT-D).
% The array consists of 66 strings of 5 series-connected modules connected in parallel (66*5*305.2 W= 100.7 kW).
%
% The 'Module' parameter of the PV Array block allows you to choose among various array types of the NREL System Advisor Model (https://sam.nrel.gov/).
%
% The manufacturer specifications for one module are:
% 
% * Number of series-connected cells : 96
% * Open-circuit voltage: Voc= 64.2 V 
% * Short-circuit current: Isc = 5.96 A
% * Voltage and current at maximum power : Vmp =54.7 V, Imp= 5.58 A
% 
% The PV array block menu allows you to plot the I-V and P-V characteristics for one module and for the whole array.
%
% The PV array block has two inputs that allow you varying sun irradiance (input 1 in W/m^2) and temperature (input 2 in degrees C).
% The irradiance and temperature profiles are defined by a Signal Builder block which is connected to the PV array inputs.

%% Simulation
%
% Run the model and observe the following sequence of events on Scopes.
%
% Simulation starts with standard test conditions (25 degrees C, 1000 W/m^2).
%
% From t=0 sec to t= 0.05 sec, pulses to Boost and VSC converters are blocked.
% PV voltage corresponds to open-circuit voltage (Nser*Voc=5*64.2=321 V, see Vmean trace on PV scope).
% The three-level bridge operates as a diode rectifier and DC link capacitors are charged above 500 V (see Vmean trace on VSC scope ).
% 
% At t=0.05 sec, Boost and VSC converters are de-blocked. DC link voltage is regulated at Vdc=500V.
% Duty cycle of boost converter is fixed (D= 0.5 as shown on PV scope). 
%
% Steady state is reached at t=0.25 sec. Resulting PV voltage is therefore V_PV = (1-D)*Vdc= (1-0.5)*500=250 V (see Vmean trace on PV scope).
% The PV array output power is 96 kW (see Pmean trace on PV scope) whereas specified maximum power with a 1000 W/m^2 irradiance is 100.7 kW.
% Observe on Scope Grid that phase A voltage and current at 25 kV bus are in phase (unity power factor). 
% At t=0.4 sec MPPT is enabled. The MPPT regulator starts regulating PV voltage by varying duty cycle in order to extract maximum power.
% Maximum power (100.4 kW) is obtained when duty cycle is D=0.454.
%
% At t=0.6 sec, PV array mean voltage =274 V as expected from PV module specifications (Nser*Vmp=5*54.7= 273.5 V).
% 
% From t=0.6 sec to t=1.1 sec, sun irradiance is ramped down from 1000 W/m^2 to 250 W/m^2. 
% MPPT continues tracking maximum power.
%
% At t=1.2 sec when irradiance has decreased to 250 W/m^2, duty cycle is D=0.461. 
% Corresponding PV voltage and power are Vmean= 268 V and Pmean=24.3 kW.
% Note that the MMPT continues tracking maximum power during this fast irradiance change.
% 
% From t=1.2 sec to t=2.5 sec sun irradiance is restored back to 1000 W/m^2 and then temperature is increased to 50 degrees C.
% in order to observe impact of temperature increase. 
% Note that when temperature increases from 25 degrees C to 50 degrees C, the array output power decreases from 100.7 kW to 93 kW.
